	<h1>Final Project</h1>
	<p>Throughout the progress of my final project, the inspiration for this was the clown IT. Like in the movie, he may want to be your friend, but if you make him mad or do not give him something he wants, he will eat you. I made it my own by making the clown a girl instead of a guy and adding more colors to her outfit. The format I used for my project was a short animation on Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. My video is about this clown name Sally walking down the desert, but comes across this kid making fun of her which made her upset and angry to the point that she grabbed him and ate him, but then after all that she walks away as if nothing happened. There was a slight change from the storyboard to the finished product. I was going to just end it with Sally the clown eating the kid, but then made me realize that people seeing this would want to see what happened next so I added her just walking away.</p>
